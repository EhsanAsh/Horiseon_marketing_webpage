## Description

- I wanted to create a more functional, accessible webpage and make it easier to read.
- This is an exercise on refactoring provided webpage and creating a functional website.
- The main goal of this project is to modify the project's **accessibility** to increase the **Search Engine Ranking**
- The final product shows that by avoiding repetitive codes, using accessibility attributes, using semantic elements, and organizing the structure of the elements, we can make a website more functional, lighter, easier to read, and more accessible.

## Installation
